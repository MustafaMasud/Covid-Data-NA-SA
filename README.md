### Project Information
This project utilized JavaScript, CSS, and the D3.js library. It is my first project with D3.js to visualize covid-data in North America and South America. 

### Running the application
You will have to turn off CORS security so the index.html file may have access to your local files. Once that is done, you may open index.html.
